# Weatherly App 🌦️

This project is a simple weather web application built with **vanilla JavaScript**. It uses the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to fetch real-time weather data and display it on the page.

The main goal of this project was to practice:
- Working with APIs
- Getting familiar with promises and `async/await`
- Linting and formatting code with ESLint and Prettier
- Getting more familiar with using Webpack
- Organizing JavaScript code

This project is part of my learning journey through **The Odin Project**.
